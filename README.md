# Bank-Marketing-Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes data from a direct marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese banking institution, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruthgn/bank-marketing-data-set/data). The campaign, executed via phone calls, aimed to promote term deposit subscriptions. The key objective is to build a classification model that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (target variable: y).

Term deposits are a critical revenue stream for banks, making their effective promotion vital. However, telemarketing campaigns are resource-intensive, often requiring multiple client interactions and substantial investment in call centers.

By analyzing the campaign data, this project seeks to:
- Evaluate the performance of various classification models.
- Identify patterns and insights to guide more effective future marketing strategies.
- Answer the central question: How can the bank improve the effectiveness of its direct marketing campaigns?
